#üìä Insights from the Bike Share Analysis (R Project)
#1.	Ride Duration
#‚Ä¢	Casual riders take longer trips on average than annual members.
#‚Ä¢	Annual members tend to have shorter, consistent ride lengths.
#2.	Rider Purpose
#‚Ä¢	Annual members mostly use bikes for commuting (short, weekday rides).
#‚Ä¢	Casual riders use bikes more for leisure and exploration, which explains the longer ride times.
#3.	Day-of-Week Patterns
#‚Ä¢	Casual riders are most active on weekends (Saturday & Sunday).
#‚Ä¢	Annual members dominate weekdays, aligning with work commutes.
#4.	Usage Patterns
#‚Ä¢	Casual riders contribute heavily to occasional spikes in ride duration, while members show steady daily usage.
#‚Ä¢	This suggests different motivations and behaviors between the two groups.



üéØ Recommendations for the Bike Company
#1.	Weekend Promotions for Casual Riders
#‚Ä¢	Offer discounted annual memberships or trial passes on Saturdays and Sundays when casual usage peaks.
#2.	Targeted Marketing Campaigns
#‚Ä¢	Use personalized messages like: ‚ÄúYou rode 8 times this month. An annual membership saves you more!‚Äù
#‚Ä¢	Highlight cost savings + convenience to casual riders who ride often.
#3.	Commuter Benefits for Members
#‚Ä¢	Add perks for annual members, such as faster checkouts, rewards for frequent commuting, or partner discounts with workplaces.
#4.	Leverage Seasonality
#‚Ä¢	If casual riders peak in summer, introduce seasonal-to-annual upgrade offers to convert them when interest is highest.
#5.	Data-Driven Segmentation
#‚Ä¢	Continue analyzing ride length, time of day, and frequency to build targeted rider personas (e.g., ‚ÄúWeekend Explorer‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúWeekdayCommuter‚Äù).
